// This is needed because if  "~/*": ["../src/*"] is set in the root tsconfig, vscode automatically inserts
// ~/ prefixed imports and it breaks sdk compilation in desktop and mobile.
// At the same time, getting rid of ~/ and using relative paths from tests is also not feasible,
// because in devtime they have to point to /src but in runtime to /dist
//
// TODO: This solution leads to 'module not found' errors in vscode for imports in tests, because vscode doesn't see
// the second tsconfig.json I assume. But if it does, there's no guarantee it will not apply auto prefixing with ~/
// to all files. Switching to prebuilt sdk should fix this issue.
